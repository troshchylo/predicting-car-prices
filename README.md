# Predicting Car Prices

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for predicting car prices using machine learning. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the price of a car based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from otomoto.pl. It includes information about various car features such as make, model, year, mileage, etc.

## Requirements
